                    the Tangasseri Light House, boasts of being the second tallest on the entire coast of Kerala and is
                    thus even one of the most visited lighthouses in the state on this account. The tower has a total
                    height of 41 metres, or 135 feet, and has been operational since the year 1902.The majestic tower is
                    clearly visible and distinct, with its painted red and white oblique bands, and looks pretty indeed
                    in all its glory and majesty.

                </h2>

                <p class="lead">Palaruvi Waterfalls, which literally translates to ‘Stream of Milk’. The white-stream
                    waterfall descending from the height of 300ft resembles the shape of a horse’s tail. An ideal time
                    to visit this place is from June to January. It is the 32nd highest waterfall in India, also known
                    to have Ayurvedic properties. The roaring sounds of the fall stand in stark contrast to the silence
                    of the forests and mist-kissed mountains around it, therefore making it among the best tourist spots
                    in Kollam.

                </h2>

                <p class="lead">Sasthamkotta Lake is the largest of its kind in Kerala and said to have derived its name
                    from an ancient Sastha Temple located near the lake. It is surrounded by hills on the 3 sides and is
                    the largest source of drinking water for the residents of Kollam. The reason for it being a
                    freshwater source is the presence of larva chaoborus in the water which is responsible of consuming
                    bacteria from the lake water and makes its healthy and fit for drinking. The lake is home for 27
                    species of freshwater fish. You can do boating and swimming in this lake.

                <p class="lead">Voted as the first 'Beach Wedding Destination' in Kerala, the Kollam Beach requires no
                    introduction. There are a lot of places to visit in Kollam, but this beach is one of the most scenic
                    and beautiful. This beach is famous among some travellers with the name of Mahatma Gandhi Beach and
                    soothes wanderers with lush green, calm backwaters, and endless water activities. The beach also has
                    a lighthouse called the Tangasseri Lighthouse, which is a major landmark there. The cultural and
                    spiritual aura of the beach is indeed contagious and fills the visitors with renewed energy and
                    passions.
